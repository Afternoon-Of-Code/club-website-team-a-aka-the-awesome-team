Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Heritage Month is an annual celebration in May that recognizes the history, culture, and contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. The month was chosen to commemorate the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants in 1843 and the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, which was built with significant labor from Chinese immigrants.
